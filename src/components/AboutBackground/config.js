I single handedly built the entire UI for a React-Native app, built new features on sites in various frameworks and languages, and was given a lot of freedom to build things the way I wanted. I enjoyed my time at Izoox, but was laid off in the summer of 2020 shortly after Covid hit and disrupted many of our clients businesses.",

Learning to code satisfied both of those conditions. I found I enjoyed the logical problem solving as well as the creative outlet that web/app development provided. So I signed up for Galvanize's 6 month web development immersive program and learned how to code.",
