I single handedly built the entire UI for a React-Native app, built new features on sites in various frameworks and languages, and was given a lot of freedom to build things the way I wanted. I enjoyed my time at Izoox, but was laid off in the summer of 2020 after Covid disrupted many of our clients businesses.",

Learning to code satisfied both of those conditions. I found I enjoyed the logical problem solving as well as the creative outlet that web/app development provided. So I signed up for Galvanize's 6 month web development immersive program and learned how to code.",
